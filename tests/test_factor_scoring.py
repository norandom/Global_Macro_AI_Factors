"""Unit tests for the version-aware-factor-scoring feature.

This is the feature's test file; later tasks append to it. Task 1.1 is a
test-only foundation: it confirms the recall_guard public MIA-primitive surface
the number-native scoring path depends on is importable, and that the directional
MemoryGuardedScorer facade is NOT on that path (Requirement 6.5).

The feature scores factor prompts via the lower-level public primitives
(NvidiaLM logprobs -> compute_mia_features -> MCSCalibrator.predict_proba, with
build_baseline / train for calibration), bypassing the directional facade so no
direction+confidence parse is required.
