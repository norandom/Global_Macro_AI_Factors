"""Steering domain for Track A — macro- and contamination-driven view shaping.

This is the new leaf module that hosts every steering symbol (see the design's
symbol-ownership table). It is a *consumer* of the existing macro framework; no
existing module imports it. Components are added one task at a time.

Task 2.1 ships the PromptRenderer: it converts the same anonymized, z-scored
point-in-time macro content the agent saw into a directional-forecast prompt that
``recall_guard``'s scorer can parse. The contamination score is computed on this
prompt by a separate logprob-bearing inference path, so it must carry the *same*
content the agent reasoned over (Requirement 1.2) and, like every Track A prompt,
must contain no calendar date and no real ticker (Requirement 1.4).

The directional prompt template is defined once, at module level, as the single
source of truth that the (later) calibration-corpus generation step reuses, so the
features the scorer derives from the macro prompts and from the calibration corpus
are comparable.

#
# The adapter owns the two-corpus calibration of the released
# ``recall_guard`` scorer (design "ScoringAdapter" + "Two-corpus calibration"
# key decision). The 72-state Track A agent log is *not* a labelled
# directional IS/OOS corpus, so the NIM model is calibrated on a dated FMP
# corpus instead: ``fmp_corpora.build_calibration`` writes two JSONL files
# (IS = pre-cutoff, label 1; OOS = post-cutoff, label 0) and returns their
# paths; the adapter reads them back via ``_read_corpus_jsonl``, projects each
# record's ``prompt`` field to a ``list[str]`` (order preserved), and passes the
# IS list as ``is_memorized`` and the OOS list as ``oos_control`` to
# ``MemoryGuardedScorer.calibrate`` (Calibration flow diagram).
#
# Requirements:
#   1.2 — the same anonymized, z-scored PIT content is scored; here the
#         calibration corpora are read back and fed to the calibrator verbatim.
#   1.5 — an empty/rejected NIM credential surfaces ``ConfigurationError``;
#         ``calibrate`` already raises it on an empty key, so it is left to
#         propagate (no catch-and-swallow).
#   1.7 — calibrator quality is surfaced via ``is_weak`` / ``holdout_auc``.
#
# The per-prompt scoring path (``score_rebalances``) is intentionally NOT in
# this task — it ships in task 2.3.

    categories so its ``consistency`` heuristic is self-contained.

    macro_hist:

    rebalance_date:
        The decision date. Only rows strictly before it are used.
    consistency_floor:
        Minimum consistency multiplier returned for a contradicting view
        (mirrors the later ``SteeringConfig.consistency_floor``).

# Task 2.5 — ViewSteerer: confidence shaping and gating.
#
# ``steer_views`` is the only place the measured contamination score and the
# macro-consistency signal touch the agent's views. Its sole effect is
# confidence/inclusion shaping (Requirement 3.4) — it NEVER changes a view's
# asset legs, expected excess, or rationale, and NEVER introduces a return /
# forecast objective (Requirement 3.5). The shaped views are consumed by the
# UNCHANGED ``LlmMacroAgent.views_to_bl``.
#
# Core formula (Requirements 3.1, 3.4):
#     adjusted_confidence = base_confidence * (1 - p_memorized) * consistency
# where ``consistency = signal.consistency(view)`` ALREADY carries the
# macro-consistency floor (task 2.4's ``characterize`` built the SteeringSignal
# with that floor). The floor is therefore NOT re-applied here — re-flooring
# would double-apply it. The result is clipped to ``[0, 1]``.
#
# Gating (Requirement 3.2): when ``p_memorized >= config.threshold`` the whole
# rebalance's views are excluded (an empty list is returned) — "down-weight or
# exclude that view" at the rebalance level.
#
# Passthrough (Requirements 1.6 additive / 1.7 weak): when ``not
# config.enabled`` OR ``p_memorized is None`` the input views are returned
# UNCHANGED. The composition (task 3.1) supplies ``p_memorized=None`` when the
# calibrator ``is_weak`` (steer_views never receives the scorer), so the
# weak-calibrator graceful-degradation case is handled here as the None case —
# the steered variant then equals plain Track A for that rebalance.

    Attributes
    ----------
    enabled:
        Master switch. ``False`` ⇒ ``steer_views`` returns the input views
        unchanged (scoring is additive; Requirement 1.6).
    threshold:
        ``p_memorized`` at/above which a rebalance's views are excluded — the
        hard contamination gate (Requirement 3.2). The research expects the
        anonymized macro prompts to yield uniformly low ``p_memorized``, so this
        gate may rarely or never fire; the ``(1 - p_memorized)`` discount applies
        continuously regardless.
    consistency_floor:
        The minimum macro-consistency multiplier. This is the floor the
        composition passes into ``characterize`` when building the
        :class:`SteeringSignal` (the single source of truth for the signal's
        floor). ``steer_views`` itself does NOT re-apply it: ``signal.consistency``
        already returns values in ``[consistency_floor, 1.0]``, so re-flooring
        here would double-apply it. The field lives on the config because the
        composition reads it from one place when constructing both the signal and
        this config.

    On the shaping path, returns a **new** ``list[MacroView]`` of **new**

    the input views are never mutated. Only ``confidence`` is changed —
    ``asset_long``, ``asset_short``, ``expected_excess_annualized`` and
    ``rationale`` are copied through unchanged (Requirement 3.4). No
    return/forecast objective is ever introduced (Requirement 3.5).

    Behaviour:

    * **Passthrough** (Requirements 1.6, 1.7): if ``not config.enabled`` OR

      content, returned as-is). The composition (task 3.1) supplies
      ``p_memorized=None`` when the calibrator ``is_weak``, so the weak-calibrator
      case degrades here to plain Track A.
    * **Gate** (Requirement 3.2): if ``p_memorized >= config.threshold`` the
      whole rebalance's views are excluded — an empty list is returned.
    * **Shape** (Requirements 3.1, 3.4): otherwise each view's confidence becomes
      ``clip(base * (1 - p_memorized) * signal.consistency(view), 0.0, 1.0)``.
      ``signal.consistency(view)`` already carries the macro-consistency floor
      (built by ``characterize``), so the floor is applied exactly once here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    views:
        The agent's views for ONE rebalance (must share that rebalance's
        ``signal`` / ``p_memorized``).
    p_memorized:
        The measured contamination score in ``[0, 1]`` for this rebalance, or
        ``None`` when scoring failed / the calibrator is weak / scoring is off.
    signal:
        The per-rebalance :class:`SteeringSignal` from ``characterize``; supplies
        the floored ``consistency(view)`` multiplier.
    config:
        Steering configuration (enabled flag, gate threshold, consistency floor).

# Task 2.6 — Prompt-version variant agent (VariantMacroAgent).
#
# ``VariantMacroAgent`` runs ALTERNATIVE prompt versions over the same PIT prompt
# stream WITHOUT modifying the committed ``macro_framework.llm_agent`` module
# (Requirement 6.1). It subclasses the read-only ``LlmMacroAgent`` and supplies a
# custom ``instructions`` string and a ``prompt_version`` label.
#
# Override mechanics (design "VariantMacroAgent" — Override mechanics):
#   * The base bakes the module-level ``AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS`` into
#     ``MacroViewSignature.__doc__`` INSIDE the private ``_ensure_ready``; the
#     base ``__init__`` exposes no instructions hook. So the subclass OVERRIDES
#     ``_ensure_ready``, mirroring the base's LM / ``dspy.Predict`` / diskcache
#     wiring line-for-line, but building the signature docstring from
#     ``self.instructions`` instead. This duplicates the base's private setup —
#     accepted as the additive cost of not editing ``llm_agent.py``; it depends on
#     a private internal of a read-only module and is a Revalidation Trigger if
#     the base ``_ensure_ready`` changes.
#   * Per-variant cache (Requirement 4.4): the base ``_cache_key`` keys on the
#     module-level ``PROMPT_VERSION`` constant ("v1") ONLY — not an instance
#     attribute — so two variants sharing one cache dir would alias each other's
#     cached responses. Each variant therefore MUST use a DISTINCT ``cache_dir``
#     and must never write the base ``CACHE_DIR`` (``.llm_cache/``). ``__init__``
#     requires ``cache_dir`` (no default) to make this explicit; prior versions
#     are preserved by their distinct cache dirs.

# fields off the already-computed scores.
#
# What it computes:
#   * The ``p_memorized`` distribution (mean / median / p90) over the parse-OK
#     scores ONLY — failure records (``parse_ok`` False / ``p_memorized`` None)
#     are excluded from the distribution so a failed score never drags the mean
#     toward 0.
#   * ``parse_fail_rate`` = fraction of scores with ``parse_ok`` False (i.e.
#     ``p_memorized`` None) over the total.
#   * ``n_scored`` = total number of scores (OK + failed).
#   * ``memguard_confidence_mean`` over the OK scores — REPORT-ONLY (design Data
#     Models note): it is surfaced for diagnostics but is NEVER a steering input,
#     because it carries the scorer's ``raw_confidence`` and using it as a factor
#     would break the non-predictive guarantee.
#
# What it deliberately does NOT do:
#   * Read the directional ``signal`` or ``raw_confidence`` (non-predictive
#     boundary — design Non-Goals); no ``signal_mean`` / ``raw_confidence_mean``.
#   * Invent ``holdout_auc`` from the scores: ``holdout_auc`` is a *scorer*
#     property, not a ``GuardedScore`` field, so it is accepted only as an
#     optional keyword arg and echoed into the dict when provided (omitted
#     otherwise).
#
# Graceful edges: an empty list or an all-failed list yields well-defined values
# (no ZeroDivision, no NaN). Distribution stats fall back to a documented sentinel
# (``_UNDEFINED_DISTRIBUTION_STAT`` = 0.0) when there is no parse-OK score to

    only — it is **never** a steering input (design Data Models note), because it
    carries the scorer's ``raw_confidence`` and using it as a factor would break

    when omitted it is absent from the returned dict.

    Empty-list and all-failed inputs are handled gracefully (no ZeroDivision, no

# Task 3.1 — Steered rebalance composition for walk-forward.
#
# ``steer_rebalance`` is the single, network-free composition that wires the
# already-built leaf pieces into ONE steered decision step, mirroring the design
# "Steered rebalance" sequence (System Flows) and the ViewSteerer Implementation
# Notes ("the steered weight_fn calls views_for_state → characterize →
# score_rebalances → steer_views → views_to_bl"):
#
#   1. ``views, _ = agent.views_for_state(macro_state, asset_snapshot)``
#   2. ``signal = characterize(macro_hist, rebalance_date, consistency_floor)``
#   3. ``p_memorized`` — ONLY when ``config.enabled`` and a scorer is present and
#      ``not scorer.is_weak``: render the directional prompt via
#      ``render_directional`` and score it on the SEPARATE inference path
#      (``scorer.score_rebalances([prompt])[0].p_memorized``, which is ``None`` on
#      a parse/timeout failure). Otherwise ``p_memorized = None`` — the
#      weak / disabled / no-scorer path, where ``steer_views`` passes through
#      (Requirements 1.6, 1.7).
#   4. ``steered_views = steer_views(views, p_memorized, signal, config)``
#   5. ``P, Q = agent.views_to_bl(steered_views, real_symbols)`` — the UNCHANGED
#      method; ``(None, None)`` when all views were excluded (Requirement 3.2),
#      and the caller's ``combine`` then falls back to the base allocation exactly
#      as Track A does.
#   6. ``steered = config.enabled and p_memorized is not None`` — True only when a
#      measured score actually shaped (or gated) the views.
#
# ``make_steered_weight_fn`` adapts this into a ``walk_forward`` ``weight_fn(ctx)
# -> pd.Series``. To AVOID owning nb09's HRP / BL / blend math (Requirement 6.1),
# that math is INJECTED: ``build_inputs(ctx) -> (macro_state, asset_snapshot)``
# derives the agent inputs from the sliced ctx, and ``combine(ctx, P, Q) ->
# pd.Series`` turns the steered (P, Q) — or the ``(None, None)`` fallback — into
# target weights. The adapter holds ONE agent instance (design note: "holds the
# same LlmMacroAgent (or VariantMacroAgent) instance") and sources
# ``real_symbols`` from the price columns when not supplied (the same symbols the
# Track A weight_fn passes via its notebook-level ``SYMBOLS`` constant).
#
# This task provides ONLY the composition + the steered/unsteered decision; it
# writes NO artifacts (Requirement 3.3 — nb11 (task 4.1) owns the targets and the
# decision log). The only steering effect is confidence/inclusion shaping via
# ``steer_views``; the scorer's directional ``signal`` / ``raw_confidence`` are
# never read and no return objective is introduced (Requirements 3.4, 3.5).

    """The outcome of one steered rebalance decision (Requirements 1.6, 3.1-3.4).

    Frozen so a decision is a stable value the (later) nb11 decision log can
    persist verbatim. Carries the UNCHANGED ``views_to_bl`` output (``P``/``Q``,
    possibly ``(None, None)`` when every view was excluded by the gate), the
    shaped (or pass-through) ``steered_views``, the measured ``p_memorized``
    (``None`` on the weak / disabled / no-scorer / scoring-failure path), the
    deterministic ``regime_label``, and a ``steered`` flag that is ``False`` when
    the decision fell back to plain Track A (unsteered).

    Attributes
    ----------
    P, Q:
        The ``LlmMacroAgent.views_to_bl`` output for the steered views — a
        ``(pd.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame)`` BL view pair, or ``(None, None)`` when no
        view survived (the caller's ``combine`` then falls back to the base
        allocation, exactly as Track A; Requirement 3.2).
    steered_views:
        The views handed to ``views_to_bl``: shaped on the steered path, the
        ORIGINAL unsteered views on the fallback path, or ``[]`` when the gate
        excluded the whole rebalance (Requirements 3.1, 3.2, 1.6).
    p_memorized:
        The measured contamination score in ``[0, 1]`` for this rebalance, or
        ``None`` when scoring was off / weak / unavailable / failed (Requirements
        1.6, 1.7).
    regime_label:
        The deterministic PIT regime label from ``characterize`` (Requirement
        2.5), carried for the decision log.
    steered:
        ``True`` only when ``config.enabled`` AND ``p_memorized is not None`` —
        i.e. a measured score actually shaped or gated the views. ``False`` on
        every fallback (disabled / weak / no scorer / scoring failure), where the
        decision equals plain Track A for that date.

    Wires the already-built pieces — ``render_directional`` (2.1),
    ``ScoringAdapter.score_rebalances`` (2.3), ``characterize`` (2.4),
    ``steer_views`` (2.5) — plus the agent's UNCHANGED ``views_to_bl`` into one
    network-free step. The agent and scorer are supplied by the caller (the
    composition holds neither), so this is unit-testable with mocks.

    Steps:

    1. ``views, _ = agent.views_for_state(macro_state, asset_snapshot)`` — the
       agent's own decision call, unchanged (Requirement 1.3 boundary).
    2. ``signal = characterize(macro_hist, rebalance_date,
       config.consistency_floor)`` — a deterministic PIT characterization of the
       macro panel strictly before the rebalance date (Requirements 2.1, 2.2).
    3. ``p_memorized`` is measured on the SEPARATE inference path ONLY when
       ``config.enabled`` AND ``scorer is not None`` AND ``not scorer.is_weak``:
       the directional prompt is rendered via ``render_directional`` and scored by
       ``scorer.score_rebalances([prompt])[0]`` (its ``p_memorized`` is ``None`` on
       a parse/timeout failure). Otherwise ``p_memorized = None`` — the weak /
       disabled / no-scorer path, where ``steer_views`` passes through
       (Requirements 1.6, 1.7).
    4. ``steered_views = steer_views(views, p_memorized, signal, config)`` — the
       only place contamination + macro consistency touch the views (confidence /
       inclusion shaping only; Requirements 3.1, 3.4, 3.5).
    5. ``P, Q = agent.views_to_bl(steered_views, real_symbols)`` — the UNCHANGED
       method; ``(None, None)`` when the gate excluded all views (Requirement 3.2).
    6. ``steered = config.enabled and p_memorized is not None``.

    No artifacts are written here (Requirement 3.3 — nb11 owns targets / decision
    log). The scorer's directional ``signal`` / ``raw_confidence`` are never read
    (Requirements 3.4, 3.5).

    Parameters
    ----------
    agent:
        An ``LlmMacroAgent`` (or ``VariantMacroAgent``) instance — only its
        ``views_for_state`` and the UNCHANGED ``views_to_bl`` are called.
    scorer:
        The calibrated scoring adapter (``ScoringAdapter`` or equivalent) exposing
        ``is_weak`` and ``score_rebalances``; ``None`` disables scoring (pass-through).
    macro_state:
        The agent's z-scored macro state for this rebalance.
    asset_snapshot:
        The agent's anonymized asset snapshot for this rebalance.
    macro_hist:
        The macro panel sliced strictly before ``rebalance_date`` (e.g.
        ``ctx["macro_panel"]``); consumed read-only by ``characterize``.
    rebalance_date:
        The decision date.
    real_symbols:
        The real tickers ``views_to_bl`` keys ``P``/``Q`` on (the price columns).
    config:
        Steering configuration (enabled flag, gate threshold, consistency floor).

    Returns a closure holding ONE agent instance (design note: "holds the same

    same agent runs ``views_for_state`` and the UNCHANGED ``views_to_bl`` for each

    (Requirement 6.1):

    * ``build_inputs(ctx) -> (macro_state, asset_snapshot)`` derives the agent
      inputs from the (already PIT-sliced) ctx.
    * ``combine(ctx, P, Q) -> pd.Series`` turns the steered ``(P, Q)`` — or the
      ``(None, None)`` fallback — into target weights, owning the BL posterior /
      base-allocation blend. When ``steer_views`` excludes all views, ``P``/``Q``
      are ``None`` and ``combine`` falls back to the base allocation, exactly as
      Track A does (Requirement 3.2).

    The weight_fn sources ``real_symbols`` from ``list(ctx["prices"].columns)``
    when ``real_symbols`` is not supplied (the real tickers, exactly as the Track
    A weight_fn in nb09), reads ``macro_hist`` from ``ctx["macro_panel"]`` and the
    date from ``ctx["rebalance_date"]``, calls ``steer_rebalance``, and returns
    ``combine(ctx, dec.P, dec.Q)``.

    This task writes no artifacts; nb11 (task 4.1) drives this weight_fn through
    ``walk_forward`` to produce the steered variant's own targets / decision log
    (Requirement 3.3).

    Parameters
    ----------
    agent:
        The agent instance reused across rebalances (only ``views_for_state`` and
        the UNCHANGED ``views_to_bl`` are called).
    scorer:
        The calibrated scoring adapter (or ``None`` to disable scoring).
    real_symbols:
        The real tickers for ``views_to_bl``; when ``None`` they are sourced from
        ``ctx["prices"].columns`` per rebalance (the Track A convention).
    build_inputs:
        Injected: maps a walk-forward ctx to ``(macro_state, asset_snapshot)``.
    combine:
        Injected: maps ``(ctx, P, Q)`` to a target-weight ``pd.Series`` (owns the
        BL / base blend; falls back to base on ``(None, None)``).
